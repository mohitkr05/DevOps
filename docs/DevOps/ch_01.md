Each step tried to answer some simple question.

1. Requirements 
- What are the requirements of the customer?
2. Design 
- How to build the software with all these requirements? 
- How the high level design looks like? 
- What are the components required 
3. Implementation
- The actual building of the software?
4. Verfication
- How is the software performing as per the requirements of the customer?
5. Maintenance
- Are there any operational issues, bug-fixes and patches required?

### Advantages

- Simple to implement
- Clear requirements

### Problem with this methodology

- Slow
- Resistant to change
- Feedback?
- Scoping issues
- Integration is painful.
